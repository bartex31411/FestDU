### HOW THIS WORKS: 
### THIS is a combination of the various doctrines into one 'super doctrine'.
### Air doctrine takes 10~ techs to finish in vanilla, this is a bit longer BUT allows you to be good at more things. You get the essentials early on, and progress further over time. 
### This is supposed to take the 'best' of each tree and combine it into one. 
### Currently, there's Dogfighting (Fighter core), a single tech for naval missions (there's not much to do with that the way air doctrine is set up), a tech tree for CAS, and a tech tree for strat destruction. You can get it all.
